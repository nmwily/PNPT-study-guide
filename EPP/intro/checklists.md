# Checklists for External Engagements
Checklists are useful for any type of engagement.
## External Pentest Checklist
An example of a basic external pentest checklist might include:
- [ ] Ensure [ROE](/PNPT/PEH/legal-and-reports/common-legal-documents.md) is signed by client
- [ ] Add IP's in scope to scope tab
- [ ] Verify customer scope
- [ ] Send 'kickoff' email
- [ ] Conduct [vulnerability scanning](/PNPT/PEH/scanning-enumeration/nessus-vuln-scanning.md)
- [ ] ID employee's emails/credentials in breach databases
- [ ] ID staff email format
- [ ] ID client's websites
- [ ] Enumerate any accounts on portals, password reset functionality, etc.
- [ ] Scan web apps if present
- [ ] Conduct manual testing and exploitation
- [ ] validate vulnerabilities found when scanning
- [ ] Conduct password spraying, etc. on login endpoints/ portals
- [ ] Escalate access from external to internal
- [ ] Validate previous findings have been resolved (if applicable)
- [ ] Cleanup

Each item should have a place to add notes and status (i.e. pending, completed, etc.).

You can also checklist out portions of the ROE/ assets which are in scope. For example, if there are 10 IP addresses in scope, make a checklist of each where you can add comments and mark when you've investigated them.

Grouping all of these things together in a spreadsheet with multiple tabs can help.
