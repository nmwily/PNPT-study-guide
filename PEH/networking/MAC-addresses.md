# MAC Addresses
MAC Addresses are relevant to Layer Two of the [OSI Reference Model](/networking/OSI/OSI-reference-model.md). They are addressing for physical devices in a local network. A MAC Address is a 48 bit hardware number which is *unique* to the device it is attached to (assigned during manufacturing).
## Network Interface Card:
In Layer 2 of networking, each device which is capable of connecting to the network is going to have its own Network Interface Card (NIC). The MAC Address identifies the device on the network, and is used by switches to route frames between devices.
## MAC Address Lookup:
MAC addresses are formatted into a 12 digit hexadecimal number. The bytes in the address can be separated by hyphens, colons, or periods depending on the operating system.

The first six digits of the number *identifies the manufacturer* of the device. A MAC Address Lookup tool can be used to figure out who manufactured the device.

Example: `00:0C:29` resolves to the manufacturer VMware, Inc
