# Identifying Website Technology
Identifying the technology being used on both the frontend, and perhaps the backend of a web application is important in the recon phase because the info can be used to plan your attack.

The technologies used likely have vulnerabilities which you can exploit later.
## Tools
### [BuiltWith](https://builtwith.com)
This is a website where you can enter the name of a website and get some basic information back about the technologies the website uses in its architecture.
### Wappalyzer
Wappalyzer is an open source tool which you can use as an [addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/wappalyzer) to your web browser or in your [command-line](https://github.com/wappalyzer/wappalyzer).

> [!Edit]
> Wappalyzer is no longer open source, they've since made all GitHub repositories private :(. See [here](https://github.com/wappalyzer). However there is [webanalyze](https://github.com/rverton/webanalyze) a Go commandline tool which used to ship w/ Wappalyzer but has switched to 'loading definitions from [enthec](https://github.com/enthec/webappanalyzer)'
### [WhatWeb](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/WhatWeb)
WhatWeb is another command line utility which comes with Kali Linux. It's open source and can be found on GitHub.
