# Effective Notekeeping

## Client Assessments:
Taking and saving screenshots from client engagements is an easy way to include proof of your assessment findings. Screenshots should include proof of the target as well including IP address, date, etc..

Taking detailed notes on an assessment is important for report writing but also for _historical records_. For example: a client may return to you months or years later asking for information about their assessment.

## Considerations:
### Security:
Notes you take on an engagement should be secured. These notes likely include sensitive information about the client's network and details which could be used against them.

Notes should also be stripped of all P.I.I. so that, in the case that they fall into the wrong hands, information they contain cannot be directly tied to a person or organization.
#### Advice from a friend:
> "I prefer storing my notes encrypted so I don't have to worry about my notes falling into the wrong hands and becoming a liability. I also try not to record anything other than what is needed to prove the finding. In almost every case, PII, PFI, PHI or other sensitive information is just not probative. Recording that information is reckless in my opinion because the notes can be breached or the fact that the information was copied to a different system can trigger fines and other liabilities for a company both contractually and regulatory.

> Additionally, I know that so many managers are [redacted] when it comes to blame-game. I never want to throw someone under the bus. If, for example, I find credit card data on Trash P's computer which is not supposed to be there and the finding indicates that the data is there because of a systemic or procedural failure, I'm not going to identify Trash P or the specific computer. I'm going to report that I found evidence of the information (and enough information to prove this) without throwing Trash under the bus."
#### Advice from another friend:
>"Usually companies require that you have hard disk encryption (like BitLocker for Windows).
>
>On top of that, most companies usually request that you purge all data besides the report after x amount of days (usually 30-90 days after the test). Each company / consultancy you work for is a bit different.
>
>Some companies you end up working for will provision you a device that has device management software that enforces those things, like updates, encryption, etc.
>
>But usually, the actual notes on testing is either standardized at each org you work for, or you're kinda left to your own devices. One company I worked for, as an example, required encrypting the Burp State, Notes, and Report using PGP encryption stored on their servers, then deleted on your end."
