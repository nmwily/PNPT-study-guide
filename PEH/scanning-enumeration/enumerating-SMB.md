# Enumerating SMB (Kioptrix)
[SMB](/networking/protocols/SMB.md) is a protocol used primarily on Windows which allows devices on the same network to share files. SMB allows for files to be written to, read, downloaded, etc..

The SMB/ "samba" service (normally hosted on ports `445` or `139`) can be accessed using the [smbclient](/CLI-tools/linux/smbclient.md) command on linux. Files hosted on SMB are referred to as "shares" and to get access to them, you need to login via a "workgroup".

In the [Kioptrix](/PNPT/PEH/scanning-enumeration/kioptrix.md) box, we can see from our [nmap](/CLI-tools/linux/nmap.md) scan that the Workgroup identified on port `445` is `MYGROUP`. 
## Versioning
Determining the version of the SMB service running is useful (and considered a finding) because you can use the version to find [CVEs](/cybersecurity/resources/CVEs.md) and exploits which have already been developed and used successfully against it.

If Nmap was unable to find the exact version with the `-sV` flag (and w/ `--version-intensity` set to 9), then you can use other tools.
### [Metasploit](/cybersecurity/tools/exploitation/metasploit.md)
Metasploit is a command line tool that can be used for most phases of an exploitation. It can do recon, scanning, enumeration, exploitation, etc.. In Kioptrix, for now, all we want to do is get the SMB version being used by our target:
#### `msfconsole`
Use this command to start the metasploit framework console. This is the environment where we'll build our exploit.

In the new shell environment, use the `search` command to find modules related to SMB.
```bash
       =[ metasploit v6.3.27-dev                          ]
+ -- --=[ 2335 exploits - 1217 auxiliary - 413 post       ]
+ -- --=[ 1385 payloads - 46 encoders - 11 nops           ]
+ -- --=[ 9 evasion                                       ]

msf6 > search SMB # This is your input
```
Once the results pop up, we're looking for an *auxiliary module* which has something to do with versioning:
```bash
...
 111  auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version                                                   normal     No     SMB Version Detection
 ...
```
This scanner module looks correct, so to use it we use the `use` command and give it the number, ie: `use 111`. With this command, we've set our module and our shell should reflect that:
```bash
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > 
```
#### Setting variables:
Once we're set our module we want to use against the target, we need to set environment variables for it to use. These include things like the target's [IP](/networking/OSI/IP-addresses.md) address, the port we want to hit, etc..

To see the list of variables needed by the module, use the `options` and/or `info` commands:
```bash
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > options
Module options (auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version):
	Name     Current Setting  Required  Description 
    ----     ---------------  --------  -----------
   RHOSTS                       yes       The target host(s), see (...)
   THREADS  1                   yes       The number of concurrent threads (max one 
										  per host)
View the full module info with the info, or info -d command.
```
We want to set the `RHOSTS` variable which will be our target's IP address. To do that, just use the `set` command:
```bash
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > set RHOSTS 10.0.3.5
RHOSTS => 10.0.2.5
```
#### Saving the output:
*Before we run the module* we might want to save the output to a file. To do that, you use the `spool` command w/ a destination file:
```bash
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > spool output.txt
```
#### Starting the module:
Now that we've chosen a module and given it a target, we can run the module with the `run` command.
```bash
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > run

[*] 10.0.3.5:139          - SMB Detected (versions:) (preferred dialect:)
							(signatures:optional)
[*] 10.0.3.5:139          - Host could not be identified: Unix (Samba 2.2.1a)
[*] 10.0.3.5:             - Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) >
```
Now we know the target is running *Samba 2.2.1a*, which we can look up for related exploits/ CVEs.
## Other SMB Enumerating Tools:
### [`nmblookup`](/CLI-tools/linux/nmblookup.md)
`nmblookup` is a CLI tool which resolves the NetBIOS names of devices on a network to their [IP addresses](/networking/OSI/IP-addresses.md). It does so by making use of queries being made on the network.
### [`nbtscan`](/CLI-tools/nbtscan.md)
`nbtscan` is another CLI command which will return information about computers on a network by sending NetBIOS status queries to the provided IP address or IP address range. It can return the following info:
- IP address
- NetBIOS computer names
- currently *logged-in users*
- [MAC Address](/networking/OSI/MAC-addresses.md)
### [enum4linux](/cybersecurity/tools/scanning-enumeration/enum4linux.md)
enum4linux is an enumeration tool made specifically for enumerating SMB information on a target (but which can return additional info as well).

Just by giving enum4linux our target's IP, and no flags, we get a lot of information back:
```bash
enum4linux 10.0.3.5
```
There is a lot of output returned including juicy information like:
1. Password policies of the target
2. user accounts and groups
3. RIDs
4. user
5. Workgroups
6. domains
7. [NetBIOS](/networking/protocols/NetBIOS.md)
8. shares
9. etc
#### Embedded commands:
enum4linux enumerates target information by using other common SMB commands. These include [`smbclient`](/CLI-tools/linux/smbclient.md), `smbget`, [`rpcclient`](/CLI-tools/linux/rpcclient.md), `net`, `nmblookup`, etc.
### Nmap `nbstat.nse` script
This Nmap script is specific for enumerating NetBIOS names and MAC addresses on the target. It returns the name of the computer logged in as well as the user. If you *increase the verbosity* it can also return all the names it *thinks the system owns*.

It will also give us the same flags that `nmblookup` gives us.

### Nmap `smb-os-discovery.nse` script
This Nmap script *initiates a connection with the target* via SMB using an anonymous account. In doing so, it's able to collect and return information including the OS, computer name, domain, workgroup, and current time.

This is possible because the SMB server *sends all of this information back when you initiate a connection* with it. Other info this script can return includes:
- Forest name
- FQDN

## TIPS
### **CHECK /etc/samba/smb.conf**
Go to `min protocol`: this needs to match the protocol of the remote target and/or the target version needs to fall w/i the range.
### RID
The *RID* is basically like using the machine's SID and adding numbers known for certain users at the end then querying if it exists...
