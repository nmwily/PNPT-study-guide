# Enumerating HTTP & HTTPS
Ports 80 and 443 are *normally* assigned to host web services using the [HTTP](/www/HTTP.md) and [HTTPS](/www/HTTPS.md) protocols (respectively). These protocols are used for communication between a web server and a web browser over the [application layer](/networking/OSI/OSI-reference-model.md) of the OSI model.
## Information Gathering
Ports 80 and 443 being present on a scan of a target indicate the target is likely hosting web services. Investigating these ports is a good way to gather information on the target. You can find out a lot about their architecture, services/ applications they use, etc..
### Via Terminal
If the target is potentially volatile, or you want to leave less of a trace, you can start by using [`curl`](/CLI-tools/linux/curl.md). With `curl`, you can get the HTML of the entire website. You can also just ask for the headers with the `-I` command, which is sneakier because the response from the target carries less data.
```bash
# Headers only: using wordcount command:
curl -I http://10.0.3.5:80 | wc -c
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current  
								  Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed    0  2890    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0 
293 
# Same command, no flags:
curl http://10.0.3.5:80 | wc -c
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current                                    Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed    100  2890  100  2890    0     0  1473k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 2822k  2890
```

You can also conceal yourself further by setting the `User-Agent` header. With `curl` the request sent to the target has a default `User-Agent` of `"curl/7.88.1"`.
```bash
curl -I http://10.0.3.5:80 --verbose
*   Trying 10.0.3.5:80...
* Connected to 10.0.3.5 (10.0.3.5) port 80 (#0)
> HEAD / HTTP/1.1
> Host: 10.0.3.5
> User-Agent: curl/7.88.1     # <--------------------------------
> Accept: */*
> 
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
```

You can set this to a less-conspicuous value such as `Mozilla/5.0 (platform; rv:geckoversion) Gecko/geckotrail Firefox/firefoxversion`, using the `-H` flag to set headers.
```bash
curl -I -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (platform; rv:geckoversion) Gecko/geckotrail Firefox/firefoxversion" http://10.0.3.5:80 --verbose
*   Trying 10.0.3.5:80... 
* Connected to 10.0.3.5 (10.0.3.5) port 80 (#0)                          
> HEAD / HTTP/1.1                                                        
> Host: 10.0.3.5                                                        
> Accept: */*
> User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (platform; rv:geckoversion) Gecko/geckotrail Firefox/firefoxversion
> 
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
```
### Via Browser
Because these ports host web services, they can be visited using a web browser. You can do this by putting the target's IP address into the search bar of a browser, and appending `:80` or `:443` to the end:
```
http://10.0.3.5:80
```
Or by using the browser from your terminal:
```bash
firefox http://10.0.3.5:80
```

## Vulnerability Scanning (w/ [nikto](/cybersecurity/tools/scanning-enumeration/vuln-scanning/nikto.md))
![Notes on Nikto CLI tool](/cybersecurity/tools/scanning-enumeration/vuln-scanning/nikto.md)
## Findings
### Hygiene
By investigating these ports, we can see a default page left up accidentally by the target. This indicates *poor hygiene* and can be included in a pen-test report as a finding.
### Information Disclosure
The URLs included in the HTML can also tell us more about the target. For example, clicking the link to "DocumentRoot" takes us to another part of the website `http://10.0.3.5:80/manual/mod/core.html#document` where we see a `404` response error code.

![](/PNPT-study-guide/PNPT-pics/enumerating-HTTP-HTTPS-2.png)
This page not only tells us that this presumably once-working link is now broken (poor hygiene), we also see *Apache versioning*, and the target's *hostname* (in this case it's localhost). This information is considered *not for us* and can be included in the report under "information disclosure".
