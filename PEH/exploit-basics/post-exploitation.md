# Post Exploitation
Once we've exploited a target, we want to know what information we have access to, because these *are findings* and the client will want to know how vulnerable their assets are. So post exploitation *consists of a lot of recon on the target*.
## Targets to enumerate
### Network Topology
We want to look at some network topology using common commands:
- `ifconfig` - [IP address](/networking/OSI/IP-addresses.md)
- `ip a` - IP address
- `arp` - [MAC Addresses](/networking/OSI/MAC-addresses.md)
- `route` - [Routing table](/networking/routing/routing-table.md)
### Sudo
As the current user we can use `sudo -l` to see what our sudo privileges are. This will show us what commands the user is allowed to run as root.
### `/etc/passwd`
*Used to list passwords of users* but now only lists users w/ an `x` placeholder.
### `/etc/shadow`
Password *hashes* are now kept in `/etc/shadow`, so we can potentially find the hashes of passwords of users on the system, and then crack those hashes to get the plaintext password using tools like [john](/cybersecurity/tools/cracking/john.md).
### Others (go into later)
- Files in the filesystem
- Devices attached to the computer
- Other devices on the network
- Services running
- Open ports
- etc.
